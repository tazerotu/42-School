Pipex ->
	multiple cmd
	Better input/output
	error_output
	Here_doc
	builtin (echo, cd, pwd, env, unset, export, exit)
	

Lexer (assigned to laicar) ->
	read line
//later task:	put it in input history (double linked list? I have that in my push_swap)
	check simple/double quotes correct (opening with ending, no mix of type eg "'"' although "''" is ok), else error
	expand: replace environment variables (eg $USER, except if between simple quotes. If not found give empty string, also handle $?)
	trim spaces outside quotes
	split into different words (can be empty string if eg "", but hola"   ciao     "bonjour is 1 word)
	split again according to < > << >> |. If multiple (eg <<<<, <> and 2>&1 are not supported) or following token isn't a word -> error
	check if last token is a pipe -> error
	do not interpret ; and \ as special characters
	last token is NULL
	output: char **prompt_str;
	if nothing is actually in the prompt... handle it at some point

Parser (assigned to laicar) ->
	typedef struct s_command
	{
		char	**redir_tok; //includes redirection symbols and their one following token in order, eg ">" "a" "<" "file.txt" ">" "b". Ends with NULL.
		char	**arg_tok; //includes everything after stripping redirections. Includes command name/given path. Ends with NULL.
	}	t_cmd;
	do a t_list *prompt_cmds containing different t_cmd in the main structure (they are separated by pipes)

Redirections/pipes
	check https://github.com/DimitriDaSilva/42_minishell#72-pipes for how to handle pipes and redirections. Multiple of the same type will create files but only write in the last (our school terminals behave differently)
	check fd validity (!= -1)

Signal ->
	Handle CTRL-C, CTRL-D, CTRL-\

Misc. ->
	check if first token of subgroup is a command or redirection, else -> error
	for each cmd args check 1st word of args, if supported builtin command (then NULL), or absolute path (then directly into cmd_path), or relative path (use PATH environment variable to look for it)
