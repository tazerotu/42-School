Execution :
✔	- cannot launch another minishell within minishell
✔	- exit code
✔	- cd -> not freed if folder not existing
✔	- cd -> if previous file deleted shouldn't break -> if getcwd() = NULL, verify if folder still exits, if not, go to trash
	- export not sorting the env when no parameter given -> bubble sort

Parser :
	- export, cd, unset, exit not working with env variable ($HOME, $PWD) -> expander keeps control char before the value of ex : $HOME (when tested, $HOME = (ASCII 1)/home/USER)

All :
	- history
	- Signals -> nothing done yet
	- Norm
